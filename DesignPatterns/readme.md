# Design Patterns

The patterns are divided into three categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

## Creational Design Patterns

These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

- [Builder](.DesignPatterns/CreationalDesignPatterns/Builder)
- [Factory Method](.DesignPatterns/CreationalDesignPatterns/FactoryMethod)
- [Object Pool](.DesignPatterns/CreationalDesignPatterns/ObjectPool)
- [Prototype](.DesignPatterns/CreationalDesignPatterns/Prototype)
- [Singleton](.DesignPatterns/CreationalDesignPatterns/Singleton)

## Structural Design Patterns

These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

- [Bridge](.DesignPatterns/StructuralDesignPatterns/Bridge)
- [Composite](.DesignPatterns/StructuralDesignPatterns/Composite)
- [Decorator](.DesignPatterns/StructuralDesignPatterns/Decorator)
- [Facade](.DesignPatterns/StructuralDesignPatterns/Facade)
- [Flyweight](.DesignPatterns/StructuralDesignPatterns/Flyweight)
- [Private Class Data](.DesignPatterns/StructuralDesignPatterns/PrivateClassData)
- [Proxy](.DesignPatterns/StructuralDesignPatterns/Proxy)

## Behavioral Design Patterns

These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.
