# Design Patterns

The patterns are divided into three categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

## Creational Design Patterns

These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

- [Abstract Factory](CreationalDesignPatterns/AbstractFactory)
- [Builder](CreationalDesignPatterns/Builder)
- [Factory Method](CreationalDesignPatterns/FactoryMethod)
- [Prototype](CreationalDesignPatterns/Prototype)
- [Singleton](CreationalDesignPatterns/Singleton)

## Structural Design Patterns

These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

- [Adapter](StructuralDesignPatterns/Adapter)
- [Bridge](StructuralDesignPatterns/Bridge)
- [Composite](StructuralDesignPatterns/Composite)
- [Decorator](StructuralDesignPatterns/Decorator)
- [Facade](StructuralDesignPatterns/Facade)
- [Flyweight](StructuralDesignPatterns/Flyweight)
- [Proxy](StructuralDesignPatterns/Proxy)

## Behavioral Design Patterns

These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

- [Chain of responsibility](BehavioralDesignPatterns/ChainOfResponsibility)
- [Command](BehavioralDesignPatterns/Command)
- [Iterator](BehavioralDesignPatterns/Iterator)
- [Mediator](BehavioralDesignPatterns/Mediator)
- [Memento](BehavioralDesignPatterns/Memento)
- [Observer](BehavioralDesignPatterns/Observer)
- [State](BehavioralDesignPatterns/State)
- [Strategy](BehavioralDesignPatterns/Strategy)
- [Template method](BehavioralDesignPatterns/TemplateMethod)
- [Visitor](BehavioralDesignPatterns/Visitor)
