# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles introduced by Robert Martin in the book "Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices". SOLID is a mnemonic that stands for:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

These principles are intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. However, it's important to note that using these principles mindlessly can cause more harm than good. The cost of applying these principles into a program’s architecture might be making it more complicated than it should be. 

It's doubtful that there’s a successful software product in which all of these principles are applied at the same time. Striving for these principles is good, but always try to be pragmatic and don’t take everything written here as dogma.
